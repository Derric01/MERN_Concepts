//execution context
/*everytime a script or a function is invoked ,js creates
a box(think of it like a memory space) to execute that code
That box is ccalled execution context(EC) 
| Type                                | What it is                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| üåê Global Execution Context (GEC)   | Created once when the script runs       |
| üß† Function Execution Context (FEC) | Created every time a function is called |
| üß™ Eval Execution Context           | (rare) Created when `eval()` is used    |

execution context will have variable environment,lexical env and this binding

üîÅ What happens behind the scenes?
‚è± Step-by-step:
outer() is called:

Creates Function Execution Context for outer

Variable a = 10 is stored in the Variable Environment

inner() function is created and remembers the Lexical Environment (the surrounding context where a exists)

inner is returned, but its closure remembers a, so it's not garbage collected

fn() is called:

fn is actually inner function

Even though outer() has finished, a = 10 is still in memory (thanks to closure)

Prints 10
